## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch,
  rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Use the
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format
  when writing a commit message, so that changelogs can be automatically
  generated
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described
  [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and summarised in the next
  few points
  * In the subject line, use the present tense
    ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not
    "Moves cursor to...")
  * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or fewer
  * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
  * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (
    `git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to
    write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Code Style Guide

* Python code should conform to the
  [PEP-8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  whenever possible.
* Where feasible, include unit tests.
* Code should pass `ruff check` with no warnings.

## Development Workflow

*General philosophies:*

* Recommended [to use uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
* Requires python3.11 or higher
* Tests should make use of the testing fixtures and tools on offer

### Getting Started

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) which will use [.tool-versions](./.tool-versions) to automatically ensure you have the correct versions

*For macOS:*
```bash
make deps
```

### Lint Checks

[Depend upon `ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), and can be executed with the following command:
```bash
make lint
```

This fast, lightweight tool handles the linting operations very quickly and efficiently and is performed within the pipeline.

### Executing Tests

```bash
make test
```

*Troubleshooting:*
When discovering the following error:
```

```
Or similar, please copy the contents of your `hostname`, on the macOS, that's:
```bash
hostname | pdcopy
```
And add it to your `/etc/hosts` file with `127.0.0.1` as `localhost` to reflect something similar to:
```
127.0.0.1   $(hostname)
```
